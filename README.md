Hello,

About one month ago, I started to use a coding tool named GameMaker ( I think you can guess what I use it for ) and after creating an asteroid shooting game
I started work on a top down shooter tutorial by Peyton Burnham. So far I am 4 and a half episodes in and everything is working well. Currently, I have a 
player ( with animation ) that moves in all eight directions , it can also shoot with four different guns. The four guns are a spread gun that fires 5 
( or any number I want ) at any angle I want, the second is a default gun that shoots at an ordinary distance with ordinary speed and power, the third 
is a rapid fire gun which ( as you may guess) shoots quickly at a large distance, the final gun , which is a power gun has a very long cooldown( a cooldown
 is a period of time you have to wait before you are able to fire again) and does a gargantuan amount of damage at long distances.

In the next section of the tutorial I will be creating moving enemies that take damage and shoot bullets.


If you would like to see the code search up Jack Blackborough Github and go onto my top down shooter project ,or use the link below for quick access.

Goodbye fo now
